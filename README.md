## What is KBEngine?

	An open source MMOG server engine. 
	Just use Python scripting to be able to complete any game logic simply and efficiently (supports hotfixing).
	Various KBEngine plugins can be quickly combined with (Unity3D, OGRE, Cocos2d-x, HTML5, etc.) technology to 
	form a complete game client.

	The engine is written in C++, and saves developers from having to re-implement common server-side 
	technology, allowing them to concentrate on game logic development, to quickly create a variety of games.

	(Because it is often asked what the upper limit of the load is that KBEngine can handle, the underlying 
	architecture has been designed as a multi-process distributed dynamic load balancing solution. In theory, 
	by continuously expanding the hardware, the upper limit of the load can also be continuously increased. 
	The upper limit of the capacity of a single machine depends on the complexity of the game logic itself.)
